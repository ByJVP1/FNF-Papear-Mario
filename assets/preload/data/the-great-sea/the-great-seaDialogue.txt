:narrator:default:After heading back out, the desert felt a lot brighter. The purple sand had turned to yellow!
:bf:default:Bep...
:olivia:default:Yeah... it's definitely a lot brighter than it was before.
:olivia:default:That stationary must have punched a hole into the sky!
:bg:tear:
:sound:altaropen:
:prof:default:Guys, look! I think the sun altar is opening!
:fade:exploring1:
:bg:exploring2:An altar the party had passed earlier was now wide open, exposing a darkened flight of stairs.
:prof:default:Well that's totally not ominious...
:prof:default:Mario you go first.
:olivia:default:It's just a staircase. That's nothing compared to an ancient temple filled with faceless toads.
:olivia:default:C'mon, let's go!
:sound:sandrun:
:fade:exploring2:
:bg:exploring3:
:narrator:default:At the bottom of the staircase was a frozen room. And in the center, a toad encased in ice.
:prof:default:Oh no! Poor guy must have spent way too long in this room with all this ancient cooling technology...
:olivia:default:Oh dear, let me try to help him. Luckily, there's a fire vellumental circle right here.
:bf:default:Beep?
:olivia:default:Yeah! Vellumentals are elementals that can harness the power of their respective elements!
:olivia:default:They've been corrupted and folded into origami by my brother, Olly, though.
:olivia:default:Luckily, I can still fold into one! Watch!
:bg:tear:
:sound:altaropen:
:narrator:default:The circle suddenly began to glow...
:bg:flash:
:sound:pheonix:
:sound:flames:
:bg:exploring4:
:narrator:default:Olivia folded herself into the fire vellumental and melted the ice with ease.
:sound:fallover:
:bg:tear:
:bg:exploring5:
:narrator:default:The toad fell to the ground. He splashed and coughed violently.
:prof:default:Hey, are you alright?
:tode:default:I... I feel...
:bg:flash:
:bg:exploring6:
:tode:default:SPLENDID! Ya-har!
:tode:default:You have freed me I see! Are ya happy to gaze upon yer captain once again after...
:tode:default:Uhm... how long it's been?
:tode:default:A week? Ten months?
:olivia:default:Our..captain? We aren't your crew.
:tode:default:Oh. Well, the names Kaph'taan Teeowed, but most just call me T. Ode...
:tode:default:...Cowards.
:tode:default:The name should be known to landlubbers like you and yer crew, young lass.
:olivia:default:Umm not exactly...
:prof:default:No WAY! The ancient sea captain T. Ode?? From the legend of Spa Marino!?
:prof:default:The story goes that he stole the Spa's prized submarine to trade it for the crown of Shroomses!
:prof:default:...Who uhh didn't take it well and-
:fade:exploring6:
:bg:exploring7:
:tode:default:Aye lad that's enough! It doesn't matter what the ol' Shroomses did! Wha I want is what's truly mine.
:olivia:default:...You mean the submarine you stole?
:tode:default:Yhar lass! Once a pirate's treasure is always a pirate's treasure.
:prof:default:It currently sits in the Mus√©e Champignon... but could you please help my friends and I on our adventure?
:tode:default:Hmm... aye! A pirate's always ready for adventure! As long as I get to keep me ship in the end I'll help ya out.
:tode:default:Now give me a rundown lassie.
:olivia:default:Will do!
:prof:default:Well I best be getting back to checking out these ancient temples. It seems this is where we part ways.
:narrator:default:Boyfriend and Mario glance at each other. They nod and continue onwards with T. Ode and Olivia.
:fade:exploring7:
:bg:exploring8:
:narrator:default:While outside, the professor called out to Boyfriend as Olivia filled in T. Ode.
:prof:default:Hey- wait, kid.
:bf:default:Bo?
:prof:default:You know... once you're done with all this, if you could maybe let Kahp'taan Teeowed know to come back here?
:prof:default:I want to tell him something...
:bf:default:Bah!
:prof:default:Thank you so much.
:fade:exploring8:
:bg:exploring9:
:narrator:default:The group entered a pipe, connecting worlds together. It also happened to be the museum that contained T. Ode's ship.
:olivia:default:Okay Captain... how do you expect to take this exhibit's main attraction in broad daylight?
:tode:default:Aye, we go in! Guns a blazing, make them beg for their life on their knees, holding a sword to their throat until they give ye the desired artifact.
:bf:default:Beep!
:tode:default:That's what we did where I come from!
:olivia:default:Umm yeah, we aren't doing that.
:fade:exploring9:
:bg:exploring10:
:tode:default:Ah! There she be! MY glorious submarine! Ain't she a beauty.
:nerdtoad:default:H-Hey! Get down from there! This exhibit is not for touching. I just cleaned it last week!
:bf:default:Ba!
:nerdtoad:default:You want to take the submarine? But it's our most prized display!
:tode:default:And what a display she be.
:olivia:default:Listen, we need the captain's boat back. He won't help us without it.
:nerdtoad:default:Okay fine... just be careful with it.
:fade:exploring10:
:bg:exploring11:
:tode:default:Yarrr! We did it crew, now we can head for the docks!
:narrator:default:A sea captain toad stood outside his ship.
:bf:default:Baa!
:captain:default:I'm on a break right now, can you wait?
:bf:default:...
:captain:default:Wait- is that you Mario!? Oh and you're with new friends this time!
:captain:default:What happened to that bob-omb though...
:bg:flash:
:bg:exploring12:
:captain:default:Well if you are going to cut my break short for important world saving stuff, at least make it go out with a bang!
:bf:default:Bah!
:captain:default:Come on new guy... show me what you got!
