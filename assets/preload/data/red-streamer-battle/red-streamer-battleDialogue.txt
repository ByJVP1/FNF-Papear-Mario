:narrator:default:Boyfriend asks if the toad knows anything about what is going on.
:toad:default:Oh uhh something about a crazy maniac folding people into mindless zombies and turning toads into small origami figures. 
:toad:default:I was a frog. Could you believe that? Haha!

:toad:default:Oh, I didn't! Mario actually came by here. He's our town's local hero!

:bf:default:Bo?
:toad:default:He went up the mountain to a place called Overlook Tower. Something about removing a streamer... I think.
