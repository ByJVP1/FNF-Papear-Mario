:narrator:default:Boyfriend asks the toad if he knows anything about what is going on.
:toad:default:Oh uhh... Something about a crazy maniac folding people into mindless zombies and turning toads into small origami figures. 
:toad:default:I was a frog. Could you believe that? Haha!

:toad:default:He's your best bet if you're looking to fix your girlfriend!
:bf:default:Beep ba?
:toad:default:He went up the mountain to a place called Overlook Tower. Something about removing a streamer... I think.
